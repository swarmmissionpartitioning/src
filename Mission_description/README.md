## M1-A1. Flying through houses 
- The swarm passes through houses along the `S' shaped path to reach the goal.
- Crashes or straggler cases are observed in the area of interest.

\item [\it M1-2.] %{\it Flying along the wall:} 
The swarm flies through an open field along the wall. 
%The mission area and duration are 500m $\times$ 500m (scale is 1/50) and 915 seconds, respectively. 
It also has crashes or straggler cases in the area of interest.
% \fix{Also, the area of interest is the end of the middle wall, as shown in the white box of \autoref{fig:missions}-(b).}

\item [\it M1-3.] %{\it Flying through high-rise buildings:} 
The swarm flies through construction site\footnote{It is inspired by monitoring mission for construction sites~\cite{dronedeploy}.}.
%Its mission area and duration are 2,000m $\times$ 2,000m (scale is 1/83) and 2,110 seconds. 
Swarm crashes to the building flying through a narrow passage, which is the area of interest.

\item [\it M1-4.] %{\it Indoor rescue support mission:} 
The swarm searches for the victim\footnote{This mission is inspired by the firefighter support mission~\cite{mins}.} to support the indoor rescue mission. 
%Mission area and duration are 25 m $\times$ 25 m (scale is 1/1) and 4,800 seconds. 
It crashes to the wall trying to enter narrow corridors in the area of interest. % as shown in \autoref{fig:missions}-(d).

\item [\it M2-1.] %{\it Flying through apartment town:} 
The swarm flies through the apartments. 
It crashes to the apartment while it tries to pass the narrow space. 
\item [\it M2-2.] %{\it Flying through downtown:} 
The swarm flies through the downtown. 
It crashes to the building in the narrow space.

\item [\it M3-1.] %{\it Flying through factory site:} 
The swarm flies through factory site to monitor around the main facility. 
It crashes to the factory building when it passes through the narrow space. 
\item [\it M3-2.] %{\it Disaster rescue mission:} 
The swarm searches victims and delivers supplies in the destroyed town. 
The narrow passage caused by collapsed buildings is the challenging area to pass.

\item [\it M4-1.] %{\it Environment monitoring:} 
The swarm monitors the mountain path for environment monitoring. It crashes to the trees in narrow space.
\item [\it M4-2.] %{\it Indoor mapping:} 
The swarm maps the unorganized inside of warehouse.
