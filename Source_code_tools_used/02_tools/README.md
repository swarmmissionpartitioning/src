# Tools for slicing, analysis, and data processing

During the project, we created several tools and scripts that slice the mission expressed as Dcc to obtaine the sub-missions. It can also assist our data analysis and processing tasks. The below list gives brief descriptions about the different tools.
Note that correct I/O paths should be set before using tools (current paths are removed as they include author's name).
