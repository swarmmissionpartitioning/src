# Code/Tools Developed 

This page contains code used in the paper including prototype, and tools.

## Prototype

Prototype folder include the prototype of our approach using A1-M1.

## Tools

This folder has tools what we used for preprocessing, data analysis, applying rules for partitioning and Dcc comparison.
Most tools are written in R.
